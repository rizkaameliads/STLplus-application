# STLplus-application
This repo applies STLplus to GRACE/GRACE-FO TTWSA data from CSR (Center for Space Research) with a 0.25-degree spatial resolution and a one-month temporal resolution. STLplus is an improved decomposition approach of seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess (STL) by Cleveland et al. (2019), developed by Ryan Hafen.
